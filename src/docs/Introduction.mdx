## Introduction

The project is a boilerplate for developing, documenting, and distributing web components in an automated way.
It uses Lit, a lightweight Web Components library, lit-html for html templates, as well as TypeScript for type-checking, Sass for styles and
Vite for Storybook fast development and build times. It also includes Rollup for bundling, and Sass for CSS preprocessing.

The project uses Wireit, a tool to handle npm scripts and configure custom watching mode for any command.
We have commands for building Sass files, analyzing Web Components files to generate a `custom-elements.json` file, 
witch is used to turn components michine-readable and be recognized for IDEs, Linters and provide a automated attributes 
list in the Storybook interactive showcases, commands for running Rollup to bundle the code generating the `dist` folder. Additionally, 
the project includes Storybook for developing, documenting and testing components.

Overall, it provides a powerful framework for creating modern, modular, and scalable web components.
