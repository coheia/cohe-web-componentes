## Introduction

The project is a boilerplate for developing, documenting, and distributing web components in an automated way.
It uses Lit, a lightweight Web Components library, lit-html for html templates, as well as TypeScript for type-checking, Sass for styles and
Vite for Storybook fast development and build times. It also includes Rollup for bundling.

Overall, it provides a powerful framework for creating modern, modular, and scalable web components.
