Proof of concept of a structure to automate the processes of development, documentation and distribution of webcomponents, designed to serve a Desgin System, or a UI Library which follows the principles of [Component Driven UI](https://www.componentdriven.org/), being built from the bottom up.

## **Get started**

> **You must have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed.**

To configure the development environment:

*   Clone the repository:

```javascript
git clone git@github.com:coheia/simple-webcomponents.git
cd simple-webcomponents
```

*   Install the required dependencies using Yarn:

```javascript
yarn
```

*   Start the development server:

```javascript
yarn dev
```

This will launch the development server at **http://localhost:6006**, where you can view the Storybook and begin developing your own web components.

Note that prior knowledge of TypeScript, Sass, Lit, and Storybook is recommended. Refer to their respective documentation for more information on these technologies.

## Stack
- [typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [lit](https://lit.dev/)
- [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Roadmap

**Alpha** components are in-development and may have many frequent breaking
changes.

**Beta** components are mostly polished and ready for use.

**Stable** components are reviewed, documented, and API complete.
